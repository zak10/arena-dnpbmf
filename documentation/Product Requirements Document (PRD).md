# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the comprehensive requirements for Arena MVP, a software evaluation platform that streamlines the vendor selection process for business leaders. This document serves as the primary reference for product managers, developers, designers, and other stakeholders involved in building and delivering the MVP.

## 1.2 Scope

Arena MVP is a web-based platform that enables business leaders to:

- Create structured software evaluation requests with specific requirements
- Receive and review standardized vendor proposals
- Compare multiple vendors in a unified format
- Make informed vendor selection decisions while maintaining anonymity

The platform will focus on:

1. Request Management
   - Free-text and document-based requirement creation
   - AI-powered requirement parsing and structuring
   - Vendor matching and filtering

2. Proposal Management  
   - Standardized vendor proposal collection
   - Side-by-side vendor comparison
   - Proposal status tracking and updates

3. Selection Process
   - Anonymous vendor evaluation
   - Proposal acceptance/rejection workflow
   - Controlled vendor communication

Out of scope items include:
- Revenue collection
- Comprehensive vendor catalog
- Seller-side features
- Team management capabilities
- Operations tools

The MVP will validate two core hypotheses:
1. Buyers find value in a centralized evaluation process
2. Vendors will provide detailed proposals for high-intent anonymous leads

# 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

## 2.1 Product Perspective
Arena MVP is a standalone web-based platform that operates independently while integrating with select external services:
- Anthropic Claude API for AI-powered requirement parsing
- Google Analytics for usage tracking
- Email service for notifications
- Authentication system for user management

The platform serves as an intermediary layer between software buyers and vendors, maintaining separation to preserve buyer anonymity while facilitating structured information exchange.

## 2.2 Product Functions
The core functions of Arena MVP include:

1. Request Management
- AI-assisted parsing of free-text requirements and documents into structured formats
- Vendor matching based on parsed requirements
- Request status tracking and updates

2. Proposal Collection & Review  
- Standardized vendor proposal submission templates
- Side-by-side proposal comparison interface
- Proposal status tracking (Pending, Under Review, Accepted, Rejected)

3. Vendor Selection
- Anonymous vendor evaluation workflow
- Proposal acceptance/rejection process
- Controlled reveal of buyer identity upon selection

4. Information Management
- Secure document storage and sharing
- Vendor catalog maintenance
- Proposal data organization

## 2.3 User Characteristics

Primary Users (Buyers):
- Business leaders and decision makers responsible for software procurement
- Limited time availability for vendor evaluation
- Varying levels of technical expertise
- Need for efficient comparison tools and organized information

Internal Users (Arena Staff):
- Product administrators managing vendor data and proposals
- Customer support handling user requests
- Technical team monitoring system performance

## 2.4 Constraints

Technical Constraints:
- Must maintain user anonymity until explicit reveal
- Limited to web browser-based access
- Manual vendor data management required initially
- No direct vendor platform access in MVP

Business Constraints:
- No revenue collection mechanisms
- Limited to buyer-side features only
- Manual proposal handling by Arena team
- No team collaboration features

## 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

Assumptions:
- Buyers will provide accurate business email addresses
- Vendors will submit proposals without direct buyer contact
- Users have basic web browser proficiency
- Internet connectivity is consistently available

Dependencies:
- Anthropic Claude API availability and performance
- Email service reliability
- Google Analytics tracking functionality
- Sufficient manual resources for vendor data maintenance
- Vendor willingness to provide standardized proposal information
