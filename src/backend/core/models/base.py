This implementation provides a robust base model class with the following key features:

1. Data Security:
- UUID primary keys for security
- Data classification with validation
- Permission-based access controls
- Comprehensive audit logging

2. Data Retention:
- Soft deletion with cascade support
- Timestamp tracking
- Deletion audit trails
- Hard delete protection

3. Audit Logging:
- Creation and update timestamps
- Classification change tracking
- Deletion tracking
- Comprehensive logging

4. Additional Features:
- Transaction management
- Enhanced validation
- Model-specific hooks
- Security-focused design

The code follows best practices including:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Proper error handling
- Security controls
- Audit logging
- Type hints through docstrings
- Clean code organization

This base class can be used by inheriting it in model classes:

```python
class Request(BaseModel):
    # Request-specific fields here
    pass
