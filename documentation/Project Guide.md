# Project Guide

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
Arena MVP is a web-based software evaluation platform designed to streamline the vendor selection process for business leaders. The platform enables anonymous vendor evaluation with standardized proposal formats, helping buyers efficiently compare software solutions while maintaining control over their selection process.

Key Features:
- AI-powered requirement parsing using Anthropic Claude
- Anonymous buyer-vendor communication
- Standardized proposal management
- Secure document storage and sharing
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Role-based access control

The system is built using a modern tech stack:
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Django with Python 3.11
- Database: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- Infrastructure: AWS (ECS, RDS, S3, CloudFront)
